When I first noticed it, it was quite mild, and it sort of went away for after a few seconds to maybe a minute.\nAnd then it sort of nothing happened for maybe a week. Or two. And then I think maybe I was doing some exercise. I was like running out running and then again I felt it and then I sort of stopped and and I felt I was feeling a little bit lightheaded at that point, which is why I sort of stopped but I don't know because I feel like there's been a lot going on as well. Recently, I had my big exams, which I'm sort of still quite stressed about because I still got more going on.\nSo I haven't been sort of living the most healthy of lives as it were.

  },
  {
    "role": "DOCTOR",
    "content": "So fantastic, so now I think would be a good time for me to examine you if that's ok. \nWe'll take some blood tests, do an ECG and I would also be quite interested in doing an echocardiogram, a jelly scan of your heart, to make sure there isn't anything that can be causing you feeling palpitations on exercise. \n\nIt may be the case that we'll call you back to do some exercise testing whilst you're being monitored, if that's ok. And sometimes what we can do is, in the meantime, we record your heart remotely. So we put you on what's called a Holter monitor, just to be able to pick up those episodes of palpitations because you mentioned it can happen sometimes a few times a day and maybe they can be captured, Especially when you are recording for three to seven days.\n\nYeah, I should probably mention in the blood test we will do some routine bloods to make sure that you're not bleeding, make sure you don't have any infection and to make sure that your hormone levels, especially your thyroid, are normal.\n\nThere is one thing I forgot to ask you about, that sometimes we check, especially with students who might be stressed; there is no chance that you might be inducing yourself to vomit? or anything like that? Sometimes that can cause people to feel quite weak and make their heart race as well."
