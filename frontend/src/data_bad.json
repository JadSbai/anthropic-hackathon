And then I think it was after you know, after that that thing started to get a bit worse. When I first noticed it, it was quite mild, and it sort of went away for after a few seconds to maybe a minute.\nAnd then it sort of nothing happened for maybe a week. Or two. And then I think maybe I was doing some exercise. I was like running out running and then again I felt it and then I sort of stopped and and I felt I was feeling a little bit lightheaded at that point, which is why I sort of stopped but I don't know because I feel like there's been a lot going on as well. Recently, I had my big exams, which I'm sort of still quite stressed about because I still got more going on.\nSo I haven't been sort of living the most healthy of lives as it were. Lots of Red Bull and coffee.\nI know that's not great. But yeah, so I don't know. That's sort of that."
